## Homelab
This repo contains all of the configuration and documentation of my homelab.

The purpose of my homelab is to learn and to have fun. Being a Cloud Native Engineer by choice, I work with kubernetes every day, and my homelab is the place where I can try out and learn new things. On the other hand, by self-hosting some applications
,it makes me feel responsible for the entire process of deploying and maintaining an applications, it makes me feel responsible for the entire process of SDLC. It forces me to think about backup strategies, security, scalability and the ease of deployment
and maintenace.
